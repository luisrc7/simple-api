Simple API Deployment Task

This project is a simple Koa based API with a single endpoint `/` that returns `hello world` and logs the user-agent.

You can run the task locally by running `yarn start`

Yan can test the API with `curl locahost:3000`

We would you like to deploy this API to AWS using which ever service you would like (This should be achieveable using services with a free tier)

We would like changes to the application to be deployed automatically on merge to master

We would like to have a simple way of inspecting the application logs
