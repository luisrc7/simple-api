API Deployment Task

* This project is a simple Koa based API with a single endpoint `/` that returns `hello world` and logs the user-agent.

* You can run the task locally by running `yarn start`

* Yan can test the API with `curl locahost:3000`

* We would you like to deploy this API to AWS using which ever services you would like (This should be achieveable using services with a free tier)

* The API should be publically accessible

* We would like changes to the application to be deployed automatically on merge to the master branch

* We would like to have a simple way of inspecting the application logs

* You should fork this repo to build your solution

* We will go through your solution in a follow-up call
